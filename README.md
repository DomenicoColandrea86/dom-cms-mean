####*dom-cms* is a "blogging" "cms" i'm building in my spare time and havent chosen a name for it yet. The plan is for it to eventually be a pretty cool fully functional blogging cms with users, tags, themes, and other cool features I can think of along the way.

#####The MEAN stack

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/ "Node.js") is a server side JavaScript execution environment. It’s a platform built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript runtime. It helps in building highly scalable and concurrent applications rapidly.

[Express](http://expressjs.com/ "Express") is lightweight framework used to build web applications in Node. It provides a number of robust features for building single and multi page web application. Express is inspired by the popular Ruby framework, Sinatra.

[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/ "MongoDB") is a schemaless NoSQL database system. MongoDB saves data in binary JSON format which makes it easier to pass data between client and server.
